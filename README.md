My project helps users find locations along their route using the Google Maps API and the Trip Advisor API. The app allows users to input a starting location and desetination and will identify top attractions along the route. 

Set up video and demo video are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1duvmP0HBR5ZXr4GiEpDBlCajIjSqmvUU?usp=drive_link):;

I wanted to build this project because it is something that I have always wanted when going on a road trip. What kind of attractions am I missing along the way? I believe this project will allow users to have more enjoyable experiences when they are going on a road trip and find different locations that are close to their route.

This was the first time I touched JavaScript, React, and Express.js, as well as the Google Maps API and Trip Advisor API. I really wanted to do this project because it exposed me to how to create a front and back end and how they can be connected and talk to each other. In the past, I used Firebase, but I wanted to build my own backend in this project to get exposure to something I had never tried before.
