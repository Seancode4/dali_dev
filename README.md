My project helps users find locations along their route using the Google Maps API and the Trip Advisor API. The app allows users to input a starting location and desetination and will identify top attractions along the route. 

Set up video and demo video are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1duvmP0HBR5ZXr4GiEpDBlCajIjSqmvUU?usp=drive_link).

The purpose of this project is to allow users to find attractions along their route from one place to another. This is something that I've always wanted to have whenever I go on a road trip. I believe this proejct will give users a more enjoyable experiences as they take their road trips and they can find new potential places to go where they can create memories that they might have not even really existed.

This was the first time I touched JavaScript, React, and Express.js, as well as the Google Maps API and Trip Advisor API. I am super glad I did this project because I learned so much how to use a variety of different frameworks. In the past, I had used Firebase, but I took this challenge as an opportunity to build out my own backend and connect it with the front end so that they can talk to each other. Everything I did was something I'd never really done before, so it was exciting to expand my toolkit in terms of both syntax/language and blueprinting/strategy of how to build a full-stack application. This also made the challenge difficult, as it was hard for me to tell which parts needed fixing when something was broken. For instance, it was hard to get Goog;e Maps markers to update when a new search was made. This has reminded me how important it is to break problems down into smaller pieces and understand what are the necessary inputs and outputs for each function.
